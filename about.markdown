# About Daniel Streefkerk

I'm a technical consultant specialising in cloud technology, SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), and security solutions. With over two decades of experience in IT and cybersecurity, I've honed my expertise in deploying security controls within complex environments.

## Professional Focus

My work focuses on helping organisations enhance their cloud architecture and security posture across major platforms including GCP, AWS, and Azure, as well as traditional on-premises Windows-based environments. I provide strategic input in developing and implementing security measures for email, web, and essential services, with particular emphasis on uplifting technologies such as:

- Active Directory and Entra ID
- Email security (DMARC/DKIM/SPF)
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Identity & Access Management

My experience spans diverse sectors including healthcare, national critical infrastructure, transport, financial services, crypto, legal, government, education, and global organisations. Throughout my career, I've been involved in:

- IT mergers and integration projects
- Cloud migrations
- Countless security configuration assessments
- Email and web security implementation projects
- Cloud architecture design and security reviews
- Identity and access management solutions
- Security monitoring and SIEM implementations
- Expert witness engagements for legal matters
- Security awareness training programs
- Compliance audits

## Philosophy

I'm a passionate advocate for pragmatic cybersecurity uplift and firmly believe in helping clients make the most of their existing solutions and security budget. My approach combines technical depth with business acumen, allowing me to deliver solutions that are both secure and aligned with organisational objectives.

I enjoy contributing to the security community through open-source project code commits, blogs, and other voluntary engagements. This blog represents part of that commitment to knowledge sharing.
